- 2019-03-14 1.9.0 beta: added deep features from VGG19 and a discriminator for GAN training.
Moved all non strictly architecture building operations outside of the model files.
The models are combined when needed in the Trainer class.
In order to allow for GAN training `fit_generator` function had to be replaced
with the more granular `train_on_batch`. Now the project relies on
custom data handlers and loggers instead of the custom Keras generator.

- 1.9.2 beta: Included tutorial notebooks, modified init files for less verbose import statements.
Comprehensive docstrings refactor.

- 2019-03-25 1.9.3 beta: now ISR models are child of the ImageModel class, whose purpose is to collect
common functions across models. At the moment it only contains a predict function that takes numpy arrays
as input and returns numpy arrays in a proper image format.
